A Kotlin library for extracting mentions from a text based on specified patterns.
It provides flexible configuration options for handling mentions in a text.

## Usage

To use the `MentionExtractor` library:

1. Create a `MentionPattern` instance and configure it according to your requirements.

2. Use the `MentionExtractor.Builder` to construct an instance of `MentionExtractor`, providing the configured `MentionPattern` and any additional settings such as the maximum number of mentions to handle.

3. Use the methods provided by `MentionExtractor` to extract mentions from text, check if a text contains a mention, or count the number of mentions in a text.

Here's an example of how to use `MentionExtractor`:

```kotlin
// Configure MentionPattern
val mentionPattern = MentionPattern().withSpecialChars()

// Create MentionExtractor instance
val extractor = MentionExtractor.Builder()
    .pattern(mentionPattern)
    .maxMentions(5)
    .build()

// Extract mentions from text
val text = "Hey @user1, did you see @user2's message?"
val mentions = extractor.fromString(text)

// Check if text contains a mention
val containsMention = extractor.containsMention(text)

// Count the number of mentions in text
val mentionCount = extractor.countMentions(text)
```

## Download / Installation

The recommended way to get MentionExtractor is to use a build manager, like Gradle or Maven.
